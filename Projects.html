            <p>
                The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of classes, objects, and arrays. The goal of this game is 
                to avoid the walls (symbolized by #) and move the player (symbolized by A) to the exit of the maze. The player is met with numerous obsticles such as 
                vanish items (symbolized by v) which hide the players position. There is a console mode which can be accessed using a tilda, and it displays all relevant information
                about the player, such as position and vanish moves till exit. Features such as a maze builder, import maze, and settings were added in more recent builds. I expirenced challenges
                in the importing process which was caused by a discrepency in reading the file. This was due to the diffrence in endl and \n. This was remedied by only reading viable characters, so the format
                of the stored array is not entirely crucial.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The Bookstore program was completed for the course COP 3330 (OOP) at Florida State University. The purpose of this game was to demonstrate my ability to 
                use multifile compilation, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation to create a cohesive store. The program works through a dynamically allocated list of 
                books (objects of class) within a register object. This solves the issue of scalability, since this program may hold as many books as alloted by your computers 
                memory. This program taught me the importance of abstraction within object oriented programming, as well as how to build a cohesive operation that scales to the users
                needs.

                This Assignment was created to demonstrate my profiencys within HTML. This website relates to my minor, Philosphy of Science, and demonstrates my ability to
                research and design a site. The website design was created for a webdesign project. The color pallet, design, and content was all designed to maximize the users
                engagement. This assignment is contained within the Freud Website button of the given site.
