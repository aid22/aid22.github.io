                Maze Game
            </h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of classes, objects, and arrays. The goal of this game is 
 to avoid the walls (symbolized by #) and move the player (symbolized by A) to the exit of the maze. The player is met with numerous obstacles such as 
 vanishing items (symbolized by v) which hide the player's position. There is a console mode that can be accessed using a tilda, and it displays all relevant information
 about the player, such as position and vanishes moves till exit. Features such as a maze builder, import maze, and settings were added in more recent builds. I experienced challenges
 in the importing process which was caused by a discrepancy in reading the file. This was due to the difference in endl and \n. This was remedied by only reading viable characters, so the format
 of the stored array is not entirely crucial.

            <p>
                The Bookstore program was completed for the course COP 3330 (OOP) at Florida State University. The purpose of this game was to demonstrate my ability to 
 use multifile compilation, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation to create a cohesive store. The program works through a dynamically allocated list of 
 books (objects of class) within a register object. This solves the issue of scalability, since this program may hold as many books as allowed by your computer's memory. This program taught me the importance of abstraction within object-oriented programming, as well as how to build a cohesive operation that scales to the user's needs.

                Is Science at War with Religion? Essay
            </h3>
            <p>
                This essay attempts to answer the question of if science and religion are in conflict. I began this essay as an attempt to formulate my own opinion on the subject matter. While I do disagree to an extent with my conclusion, I believe that this essay is an example of my writing skills as well as my understanding of philosophy.
