                    Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                    I have been programming since high school, and worked and posted numerous projects since.  As I progressed through middle school, my interests shifted towards mathematics, and I envisioned a future as a mathematician. However, it was during this time that I stumbled upon the world of technology, and it captivated me instantly. I would stay awake late into the night, engrossed in videos that taught me how to assemble computers, and I eagerly filled my mom's Amazon cart with essential components like CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, and PSUs.

                    Driven by this newfound love for technology, I made a significant decision during my sophomore year of high school: to enroll in a programming course. This course primarily focused on the fundamentals of Python. I dedicated countless hours to crafting intricate programs that exceeded the course requirements. My final project for this high school course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 
    
                    <br><br>
                    As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. In my Freshman year I taught myself HTML, and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.

                        During my high school years, I actively pursued programming opportunities by enrolling in courses offered by the Florida Virtual School. I excelled academically and demonstrated advanced proficiency, leading to the decision to skip my senior year. As a result, I graduated in my junior year, while actively participating in extracurricular activities such as membership in the esteemed Mu Alpha Theta mathematics honor society at Robinson High School, along with various other clubs.

                    Maze Game

                <p>
                    This project aimed to showcase my comprehensive understanding of classes, objects, and arrays. The primary objective of the game was to navigate the player (represented by the symbol A) through a maze while avoiding walls (symbolized by #) and reaching the exit. Along the way, the player encountered various obstacles, including vanishing items (symbolized by v) that concealed their position. A console mode, accessible through the tilda key, provided essential information about the player, such as their current position and the number of vanishes until reaching the exit.

Furthermore, recent builds of the game introduced additional features like a maze builder, the ability to import mazes, and customizable settings. During the development process, I encountered challenges with the maze import functionality, primarily due to inconsistencies in reading the file caused by differences between the endl and \n characters. To overcome this hurdle, I implemented a solution that selectively reads viable characters, ensuring that the exact format of the stored array became less critical.

                    The Bookstore program was completed for the course COP 3330 (OOP) at Florida State University. The purpose of this game was to demonstrate my ability to 
     use multifile compilation, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation to create a cohesive store. The program works through a dynamically allocated list of 
     books (objects of class) within a register object. This solves the issue of scalability, since this program may hold as many books as allowed by your computer's memory. This program taught me the importance of abstraction within object-oriented programming, as well as how to build a cohesive operation that scales to the user's needs.

                    his essay serves as a comprehensive exploration of the foundational principles of Freudian teachings. It was conceived as a personal project, driven by my deep fascination and curiosity for both Philosophy and Psychology. The primary objective of this endeavor was to delve into the intricate concepts and theories proposed by Sigmund Freud, thereby expanding my knowledge and understanding in these interconnected fields. I delved into a wide range of scholarly sources, critically analyzing and synthesizing information to provide a comprehensive overview of Freud's teachings.
