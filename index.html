            <p> 
                Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                I have been programming since highschool, and worked and posted numerous projects since. I was born in Tampa, Florida on December 7th, 2003.
                My dreams of becoming a software engineer evolved from my elementry dreams to become a scientist. These dreams later evolved into a mathmatician in 
                middle school. In middle school I discoved technology and instantly fell in love. I would spend nights staying awake watching videos constructing computers. Filling
                my mom's amazon cart with CPU's, GPU's, Motherboards, and PSU's. From this love I decided my sophmore year of highschool to take a programming course. This course
                was centered on the basics of python, and in retrospect fairly rudimentary. I loved this course, I spent hours developing complex programs that went above and beyond 
                the courses requirements. My final project for this highschool course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 

                <br><br>
                Following my completion of the course (which I completed in a few weeks due to it being an FLVS course), I was left in a drought. I begun finding programming tutorials, learning c++ and python. I took the final python course as well, which further confirmed that I loved programming.
                As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. My Freshman year I taught myself HTML, and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.
