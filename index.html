            <p> 
                Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                I have been programming since high school and worked and posted numerous projects since. I was born in Tampa, Florida on December 7th, 2003.
                My dreams of becoming a software engineer evolved from my elementary dreams to become a scientist. These dreams later evolved into a mathematician in 
                middle school. In middle school, I discovered technology and instantly fell in love. I would spend nights staying awake watching videos and constructing computers. Filling
                my mom's Amazon cart with CPUs, GPUs, Motherboards, and PSUs. From this love, I decided in my sophomore year of high school to take a programming course. This course
                was centered on the basics of Python, and in retrospect fairly rudimentary. I loved this course, I spent hours developing complex programs that went above and beyond 
                the course requirements. My final project for this high school course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 

                <br><br>
                Following my completion of the course (which I completed in a few weeks due to it being an FLVS course), I was left in a drought. I began finding programming tutorials and learning C++ and Python. I took the final Python course as well, which further confirmed that I loved programming.
                As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. In my Freshman year, I taught myself HTML and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.
