                    Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                    I have been programming since highschool, and worked and posted numerous projects since. I was born in Tampa, Florida on December 7th, 2003.
                    My dreams of becoming a software engineer evolved from my elementry dreams to become a scientist. These dreams later evolved into a mathmatician in 
                    middle school. In middle school I discoved technology and instantly fell in love. I would spend nights staying awake watching videos constructing computers. Filling
                    my mom's amazon cart with CPU's, GPU's, Motherboards, and PSU's. From this love I decided my sophmore year of highschool to take a programming course. This course
                    was centered on the basics of python, and in retrospect fairly rudimentary. I loved this course, I spent hours developing complex programs that went above and beyond 
                    the courses requirements. My final project for this highschool course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 
    
                    <br><br>
                    Following my completion of the course (which I completed in a few weeks due to it being an FLVS course), I was left in a drought. I begun finding programming tutorials, learning c++ and python. I took the final python course as well, which further confirmed that I loved programming.
                    As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. My Freshman year I taught myself HTML, and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.

                    The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of classes, objects, and arrays. The goal of this game is 
     to avoid the walls (symbolized by #) and move the player (symbolized by A) to the exit of the maze. The player is met with numerous obstacles such as 
     vanishing items (symbolized by v) which hide the player's position. There is a console mode that can be accessed using a tilda, and it displays all relevant information
     about the player, such as position and vanishes moves till exit. Features such as a maze builder, import maze, and settings were added in more recent builds. I experienced challenges
     in the importing process which was caused by a discrepancy in reading the file. This was due to the difference in endl and \n. This was remedied by only reading viable characters, so the format
     of the stored array is not entirely crucial.

                    The Bookstore program was completed for the course COP 3330 (OOP) at Florida State University. The purpose of this game was to demonstrate my ability to 
     use multifile compilation, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation to create a cohesive store. The program works through a dynamically allocated list of 
     books (objects of class) within a register object. This solves the issue of scalability, since this program may hold as many books as allowed by your computer's memory. This program taught me the importance of abstraction within object-oriented programming, as well as how to build a cohesive operation that scales to the user's needs.
