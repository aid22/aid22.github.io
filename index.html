                    Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                    I have been programming since high school, and worked and posted numerous projects since.  As I progressed through middle school, my interests shifted towards mathematics, and I envisioned a future as a mathematician. However, it was during this time that I stumbled upon the world of technology, and it captivated me instantly. I would stay awake late into the night, engrossed in videos that taught me how to assemble computers, and I eagerly filled my mom's Amazon cart with essential components like CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, and PSUs.

                    Driven by this newfound love for technology, I made a significant decision during my sophomore year of high school: to enroll in a programming course. This course primarily focused on the fundamentals of Python. I dedicated countless hours to crafting intricate programs that exceeded the course requirements. My final project for this high school course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 
    
                    <br><br>
                    As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. My Freshman year I taught myself HTML, and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.

                        communication within the feild of design. I plan to further 
                        my education beyond a bachelor's degree so that I may develop 
                        my understanding of computer systems, and the ways in which

                        During my high school years, I actively pursued programming opportunities by enrolling in courses offered by the Florida Virtual School. I excelled academically and demonstrated advanced proficiency, leading to the decision to skip my senior year. As a result, I graduated in my junior year, while actively participating in extracurricular activities such as membership in the esteemed Mu Alpha Theta mathematics honor society at Robinson High School, along with various other clubs.

                    unity in preparation for this project. I also learned how to create pixel art, which I hope to carry further into my own game development. Working made such a large project seem managable.

                    The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate my ability to utilize data structures to improve upon a nuilt in software <code>wc</code>
                    in order to solve this problem I paired hashmaps with correlating intreger values to their respective number, character, and word counts. The program
                    counted the number of occurances in each and sorted them in order to display the top five. The program works quickly with files exceding 50,000 lines and
                    over a million characters. To view my solution email me <a href = "mailto: awa22@fsu.edu">awa22@fsu.edu</a> (per Honor Code requirements).

                    This project was an attempt to create a cohesive fitness website centered around the user. I challenged myself within this project 
                    to implement an API. I have not previously worked with api within html, so this was a fun challenge to conquer.
