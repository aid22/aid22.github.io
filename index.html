                    Hello! My name is Aiden Allen. I am an aspiring software engineer currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida State University.
                    I have been programming since high school, and worked and posted numerous projects since.  As I progressed through middle school, my interests shifted towards mathematics, and I envisioned a future as a mathematician. However, it was during this time that I stumbled upon the world of technology, and it captivated me instantly. I would stay awake late into the night, engrossed in videos that taught me how to assemble computers, and I eagerly filled my mom's Amazon cart with essential components like CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, and PSUs.

                    Driven by this newfound love for technology, I made a significant decision during my sophomore year of high school: to enroll in a programming course. This course primarily focused on the fundamentals of Python. I dedicated countless hours to crafting intricate programs that exceeded the course requirements. My final project for this high school course can be found <a href="https://github.com/awa03/FSU-Projects/blob/main/j.py">here</a>. 
    
                    <br><br>
                    As I entered college for Computer Science I continued to watch tutorial after tutorial learning everything I can about programming. My Freshman year I taught myself HTML, and started taking notes through my website. The <a href="https://awa03.github.io/">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awa03/awa03.github.io">source code</a> of which are published on my github.

                        communication within the feild of design. I plan to further 
                        my education beyond a bachelor's degree so that I may develop

                        During my high school years, I actively pursued programming opportunities by enrolling in courses offered by the Florida Virtual School. I excelled academically and demonstrated advanced proficiency, leading to the decision to skip my senior year. As a result, I graduated in my junior year, while actively participating in extracurricular activities such as membership in the esteemed Mu Alpha Theta mathematics honor society at Robinson High School, along with various other clubs.

Within this project I worked with 4 other group mates to develop a game in which the player defeat waves of enemies in a tower defense style. I was responsible for developing the tutorial scenes, the save data, the shop, as well as the player. Additionally, I learned c# in order to complete this project. This project taught me valuble skills in teamwork, and communication.

                    This project was developed for my COP4530 course (Data structures 2). This project encompasses a hashtable library, and a spell checker, both of which were created for the purpose of this project. The spell checker is able to read in a dictionary, and compare it to a text file. The spell checker will then output the words that are not in the dictionary, and prompt the user to correct it (using FTXUI library). This project taught me valuble skills in data structures, and the importance of efficent code.
