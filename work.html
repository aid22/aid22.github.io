                I have volenteered at many programs such as VBS and Metropolitan Ministries. I began 
                volenteering in elementry school. Much of my volenteering opertunitys came from my mom. She allowed me to get into
                volenteering at a young age, because of this I was able to assist special needs students in Church events, teach children at 
                VBS, serve and prepare food for the homeless, and Build Houses in West Virgina all from a young age.
