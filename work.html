                    Throughout my employment at Fire House Subs I learned various skills.

                I have volunteered at many programs such as VBS and Metropolitan Ministries. I began 
                volunteering in elementary school. Many of my volunteering opportunities came from my mom. She allowed me to get into
                volunteering at a young age, because of this I was able to assist special needs students in Church events, teach children at 
                VBS, serve and prepare food for the homeless, and Build Houses in West Virginia all from a young age.
