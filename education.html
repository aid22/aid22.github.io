                I currently attend Florida State University.<br>
                <strong>Grade -</strong> Sophmore <br>
                <strong>Major -</strong> Computer Science <br>
                <strong>Minor -</strong> Philosphy of Science <br> <br>
                I have been attending FSU since summer 2022. Through my short <br>
                time so far at FSU I have learned the importance of teamwork and <br>
                communication within the feild of design. I hope to further <br>
                my education beyond a bachelor's degree so that I may develop <br>
                my understanding of computer systems, and the ways in which <br>
                they interact with one another.
